feat: Adjust layout and prepare for GitHub Pages deployment

- Resolved git merge conflicts in `app.py` and `templates/index.html`.
- Refactored "Nossa Equipe" section: moved block, adjusted spacing and card width,
  added descriptive text, and justified card text.
- Standardized colors for titles in "Quem Somos", "Simuladores", and "Blog" sections.
- Refined section spacing: reduced distance between "Home" and "Quem Somos",
  adjusted background colors for "Quem Somos" (white) and "Blog" (gray-light).
- Eliminated all section separating lines.
- Prepared `index.html` for GitHub Pages by converting dynamic Flask `url_for`
  calls for service icons to static relative paths.
- Updated `changes_summary.md` to reflect these changes.
